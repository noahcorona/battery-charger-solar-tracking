# Battery Bank with Active-Tracking Solar


This project was completed in the Winter 2021 quarter at UCSB for the ECE 153B course. With one month, this repo demonstrates my work for my final project, which was an idea of my own choosing. It was built with the help of the Keil ÂµVision IDE, and at its heart is an STM32 Nucleo board. 

The `CAD` folder includes 3D CAD files (.stl) for an enclosure and a mounting board for the solar panel, as well as recommended inexpensive solar panels to use. 

The `documents` folder contains a word document describing GPIO connections, CAD choices, as well as the timing calculations that are necessary to use the STM32 with the connected devices (multiplexer, 14-degment display, etc.).
